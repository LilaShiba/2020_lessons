'''
You are given a tree with an even number of nodes. 
Consider each connection between a parent and child 
node to be an "edge". You would like to remove some of 
these edges, such that the disconnected subtrees that 
remain each have an even number of nodes.

For example, suppose your input was the following tree:

   1
  / \ 
 2   3
    / \ 
   4   5
 / | \
6  7  8
